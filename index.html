            <h2>Operators</h2>
            <p>Operators in JavaScript are very similar to operators that appear in other programming languages. The definition of an operator is a symbol that is used to perform an operation. Most often these operations are arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc), but not always.</p>

            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container. Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows. Storing a value in a variable is called variable initialization.</p>

            <h2>Arguments</h2>
            <p>The arguments object is a local variable available within all functions. You can refer to a function's arguments within the function by using the arguments object. This object contains an entry for each argument passed to the function, the first entry's index starting at 0.</p>
